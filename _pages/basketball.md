    My basketball journey is marked by an array of specialized equipment, particularly my extensive collection of basketball shoes. Among my prized possessions are the Lebron NXXT Gen and the GT Cut 3 EP. However, my unequivocal favorite is the Kobe 8 Protro Halo, distinguished by its unparalleled cushioning and pristine white aesthetic.

## Personal Experiences and Achievements

  <div class="card-body">
    My involvement in basketball extends across numerous clubs and competitive teams. I have had the privilege of playing for various ATB YISS teams, culminating in a position on the YISS B team during my sixth-grade year. Predominantly occupying the roles of shooting guard or power forward, I compensated for my less refined ball-handling skills by focusing on shooting, leveraging my comparatively slight physique.<br />

    I am currently aspiring to join the U13 Samsung Thunders, based in Bundang, as well as the SIS Basketball Team. My playing career has also been enriched by encounters with AAU players from America, broadening my competitive horizons.<br />

    While I am naturally inclined towards playmaking, favoring assists over scoring, I have honed a repertoire of moves that includes a paint backboard floater, a pull-up three-pointer, and a mid-range shot. My preferred shooting zone is any mid-range area near the free-throw line, where I feel most adept and confident.
