    My school life is marked by the friendships I have cultivated over the years at two distinct international schools. For seven years, I attended the <strong>Yongsan International School of Seoul (YISS)</strong> in Seoul, where I built enduring relationships. Additionally, I have developed meaningful connections at the <strong>Seoul International School (SIS)</strong> in Gyeonggi-do.
